A basic rule of thumb in modularity is that components that are **highly related** should be grouped together. This principle is known as **cohesion** in software engineerin

By default, everything we define inside a module is considered **private**, meaning it is not accessible from outside the module. To make something available to other parts of the application, we need to **explicitly export** it.
